## Workshop description
This workshop will introduce participants to stable isotopes as a means of creating spatially-explicit models of animal origin. We will cover the research and management applications of stable isotopes; study design and sample analysis; obtaining environmental isotope data; relating tissue to environmental isotope data; creating probabilistic models of individual origin; new methods of validating probabilistic models; and, time permitting, emerging methods to group and compare individuals by varying origins. Participants will be encouraged to bring their own computers and will be provided with instructions as to how to load R packages and datasets to perform example analyses during the workshop. We also encourage participants to, when applicable, bring application questions and their own data for consultation during or after the workshop.
